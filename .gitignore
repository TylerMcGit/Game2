# Custom ignore files (optional)
# -----------------------------
# If you have specific files or folders you want to ignore that aren't covered
# by the above, you can add them here.
# For example, a custom build output folder:
# MyBuilds/

# Recommended for Unity projects, but uncomment only if you understand the implications:
# If you are using Unity Cloud Build and want to exclude specific folders, uncomment these:
# # Uncomment to ignore your own custom build output folder:
# # Builds/
# # Uncomment to ignore the streaming assets folder:
# # Assets/StreamingAssets/
